# Overview

In STA 210, students will learn how linear and logistic regression models are used to explore multivariable relationships and apply these methods to answer relevant and engaging questions using a data-driven approach. Students will develop computing skills to implement a reproducible data analysis workflow and gain experience communicating statistical results. Throughout the semester, students will work on a team project where they will develop a research question, answer it using methods learned in the course, and share results through a written report and presentation.

Topics include applications of linear and logistic regression, interpretation, diagnostics, model selection, and model assessment. Students will gain experience using the computing tools R and GitHub to analyze real-world data from a variety of fields. This class emphasizes data analysis over mathematical theory.
