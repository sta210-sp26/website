Complete all prepare readings and tasks before class.\n\n2.  Actively participate and engage in lectures and labs.\n\n3.  Ask questions frequently during lecture, in office hours, on Ed Discussion, and among your classmates.\n\n4.  Complete all homework and labs, asking yourself “why” questions as you go through the steps to complete each exercise.\n\n5.  Stay current with the course material, as each new concept builds on previous ones.\n\n# Questions?\n\n## Minute paper {.midi}\n\nSubmit your response to the question below.
