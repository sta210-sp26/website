Draw or describe a scatterplot that contains an observation with large leverage but low Cook’s distance.\n\nb.  Draw or describe a scatterplot that contains an observation with large leverage and high Cook’s distance.\n\nc.  Draw or describe a scatterplot that contains an observation with a large studentized residual.\n\n## Data: Credit cards\n\nThe data for this analysis is about credit card customers. It can be found in the file `credit.csv`. The following variables are in the data set:\n\n-   `income`: Income in \\$1,000's\n-   `limit`: Credit limit\n-   `rating`: Credit rating\n-   `cards`: Number of credit cards\n-   `age`: Age in years\n-   `education`: Number of years of education\n-   `own`: A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating whether the individual owns their home\n-   `student`: A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating whether the individual was a student\n-   `married`: A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating whether the individual was married\n-   `region`: A factor with levels `South`, `East`, and `West` indicating the region of the US the individual is from\n-   `balance`: Average credit card balance in \\$.\n\n**The objective of this analysis is to predict whether a person has maxed out their credit card, i.e., had \\$0 average card balance.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncredit <- read_csv(\"data/credit.csv\") |>\n  mutate(maxed = factor(if_else(balance == 0, 1, 0)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 2\n\n-   Why is logistic regression the best modeling approach for this analysis?\n\n-   Describe where each of the following show up in the analysis:\n\n    -   log-odds ...\n\n    -   odds\n\n    -   probabilities\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nWe’ll start by splitting the model into training and testing data. Then we'll using the training data to fit a model for predicting the odds of `maxed = 1` using `income`, `rating`, and `region`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# make training and test sets\nset.seed(210)\ncredit_split <- initial_split(credit, prop = 0.8)\ncredit_train <- training(credit_split)\ncredit_test <- testing(credit_split)\n\ncredit_fit <- glm(maxed ~ income + rating + region, data = credit_train, \n                  family = \"binomial\")\n\ntidy(credit_fit) |>\n  kable(digits = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term        | estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value|\n|:-----------|--------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|\n|(Intercept) |   10.097|     1.687|     5.987|   0.000|\n|income      |    0.115|     0.026|     4.444|   0.000|\n|rating      |   -0.058|     0.009|    -6.428|   0.000|\n|regionSouth |   -0.632|     0.715|    -0.884|   0.377|\n|regionWest  |   -0.332|     0.724|    -0.458|   0.647|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe logistic regression model takes the following form:\n\n$$\n \\log(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1 - \\pi_i}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 ~ income + \\beta_2 ~ rating + \\beta_3 ~ regionSouth + \\beta_4 ~ regionWest\n$$\n\na.  Write the interpretation of `income` in terms of the odds of maxing out a credit card.\n\nb.  Use the equation above to show the expected change in the odds of maxing out a credit card when the credit rating increases by 10 points. Assume income and region are constant. Write your answer in terms of $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4$.\n\nc.  Suppose there are two individuals. Individual 1 has an income of \\$64,000, a credit rating of 590, and is from the South region. Individual 2 has an income of \\$135,000, a credit rating of 695, and is from the East region. Use the equation above to show how the odds of maxing out a credit card differ between Individual 1 and Individual 2. Write your answer in terms of $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2$, etc.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nWe consider adding the interaction between `region` and `income` to the current model. We'll use a drop-in-deviance test to determine whether or not to add the interaction term.\n\na.  State the null and alternative hypotheses in words and using mathematical notation.\nb.  Describe what the test statistic $G$ means in the context of the data.\nc.  Show why the degrees of freedom for the test statistic are equal to 2.\nd.  Conduct the drop-in-deviance test and state your conclusion in the context of the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nNow let's evaluate the performance of the selected model using the testing data.\n\nCreate a confusion matrix using a cutoff probability of 0.3.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   What is the sensitivity?
