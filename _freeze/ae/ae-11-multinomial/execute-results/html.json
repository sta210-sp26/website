What do you observe from the plot?\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nCreate a plot to visualize the relationship between the response, `viewcat` and `age`. What do you observe from the plot?\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nFit a model using the `ageCent` and `viewenc` to understand the odds a child is in a given category of `viewcat`. Display the model including 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\n-   What is the baseline category for `viewcat`? What is the baseline category for `viewenc`?\n\n-   Interpret the intercept associated with the odds of a child being in the category `viewcat == 2` versus the baseline.\n\n-   Interpret the effect of age in terms of the odds of a child being in the category `viewcat == 2` versus the baseline. Based on the confidence interval for the coefficient, is the numeric predictor a statistically significant predictor of viewership?\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nShould the interaction between `ageCent` and `viewenc` be included in the model? Show any analysis used to make your conclusion.\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nThe primary objective of the experiment was to understand the effect of encouragement on viewership. Does encouragement have a significant effect on viewership after adjusting for age? If so, describe the effect. Otherwise, explain why not.\n\n## Exercise 7\n\n-   Use the model selected in Exercise 5 to compute the predicted probabilities and predicted classes for `viewcat`.\n\n-   Make a confusion matrix.\n\n-   What percentage of observations were correctly classified?\n\n## Exercise 8\n\n-   Assess the overall model performance.\n\n-   Were there particular categories in which the model has a harder time differentiating?\n\n# Submission\n\n::: callout-important\nTo submit the AE:\n\n-   Render the document to produce the PDF with all of your work from today’s class.\n\n-   Push all your work to your AE repo on GitHub. You’re done! 🎉\n:::\n",
