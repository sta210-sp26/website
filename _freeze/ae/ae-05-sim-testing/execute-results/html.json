It was originally scraped from Zillow, and can be found in the `duke_forest` data set in the **openintro** R package.\n\n**Goal: Use statistical inference to evaluate whether there is a relationship between the age of the house at time of sale and its price.**\n\n## Exploratory data analysis\n\nLet's begin by creating a new variable that is the age of the house in 2020.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nduke_forest <- duke_forest |>\n  mutate(age_2020 = 2020 - year_built)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow let's visualize the relationship between the age of the house in 2020 and the sales price.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = age_2020, y = price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Age in 2020 (years)\",\n    y = \"Sale price (USD)\",\n    title = \"Price and age of houses in Duke Forest\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-05-sim-testing_files/figure-html/scatterplot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Model\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_fit <- lm(price ~ age_2020, data = duke_forest)\n\ntidy(df_fit) |>\n  kable(digits = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term        |   estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value|\n|:-----------|----------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|\n|(Intercept) | 690891.015| 68637.793|    10.066|   0.000|\n|age_2020    |  -2473.935|  1225.191|    -2.019|   0.046|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Hypothesis test\n\n::: callout-tip\nFor code chunks with fill-in-the-blank code, change code chunk option to `#| eval: true` once you've filled in the code.\n:::\n\n### State the null and alternative hypotheses\n\nWrite the null and alternative hypotheses in words and mathematical notation.\n\n### Generate null distribution using permutation\n\nFill in the code, then set `eval: true` .\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn = 100\nset.seed(01232025)\n\nnull_dist <- _____ |>\n  specify(______) |>\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") |>\n  generate(reps = _____, type = \"permute\") |>\n  fit()\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Visualize distribution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Code for histogram of null distribution\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Calculate the p-value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# get observed fit \nobserved_fit <- duke_forest |>\n  specify(price ~ age_2020) |>\n  fit()\n\n# calculate p-value\nget_p_value(\n  ____,\n  obs_stat = ____,\n  direction = \"two-sided\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### State conclusion\n\nWrite your conclusion in the context of the data.
