## Data: Houses in Duke Forest

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Data on houses that were sold in the Duke Forest neighborhood of Durham, NC around November 2020
-   Scraped from Zillow
-   Source: [`openintro::duke_forest`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/duke_forest.html)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/04/duke_forest_home.jpg){fig-alt="Home in Duke Forest"}
:::
:::::

**Goal**: Use the area (in square feet) to understand variability in the price of houses in Duke Forest.

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    x = "Area (square feet)",
    y = "Sales price (USD)",
    title = "Price and area of houses in Duke Forest"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) 
```

## Modeling {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: true
df_fit <- lm(price ~ area, data = duke_forest)

tidy(df_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2) #neatly format table to 2 digits
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
intercept <- tidy(df_fit) |> filter(term == "(Intercept)") |> pull(estimate) |> round()
slope <- tidy(df_fit) |> filter(term == "area") |> pull(estimate) |> round()
```

-   **Intercept:** Duke Forest houses that are 0 square feet are expected to sell, for `r dollar(intercept)`, on average.
    -   Is this interpretation meaningful?
-   **Slope:** For each additional square foot, we expect the sales price of Duke Forest houses to be higher by `r dollar(slope)`, on average.

## From sample to population {.midi}

> For each additional square foot, we expect the sales price of Duke Forest houses to be higher by `r dollar(slope)`, on average.

<br>

-   This estimate is valid for the single sample of `r nrow(duke_forest)` houses.
-   But what if we're not interested quantifying the relationship between the size and price of a house in this single sample?
-   What if we want to say something about the relationship between these variables for all houses in Duke Forest?

## Statistical inference

-   **Statistical inference** provide methods and tools so we can use the single observed sample to make valid statements (inferences) about the population it comes from

-   For our inferences to be valid, the sample should be random and representative of the population we're interested in

## Inference for simple linear regression

-   Compute a confidence interval for the slope, $\beta_1$

-   Conduct a hypothesis test for the slope,$\beta_1$

# Confidence interval for the slope

## Confidence interval {.midi}

::: incremental
-   A plausible range of values for a population parameter is called a **confidence interval**
-   Using only a single point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net
    -   We can throw a spear where we saw a fish but we will probably miss, if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish
    -   Similarly, if we report a point estimate, we probably will not hit the exact population parameter, but if we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter
:::

## Confidence interval for the slope {.midi}

A confidence interval will allow us to make a statement like "*For each additional square foot, the model predicts the sales price of Duke Forest houses to be higher, on average, by `r dollar(slope)`, plus or minus X dollars.*"

. . .

-   Should X be \$10? \$100? \$1000?

-   If we were to take another sample of `r nrow(duke_forest)` would we expect the slope calculated based on that sample to be exactly `r dollar(slope)`? Off by \$10? \$100? \$1000?

-   The answer depends on how variable (from one sample to another sample) the sample statistic (the slope) is

-   We need a way to quantify the variability of the sample statistic

## Quantify the variability of the slope {.midi}

**for estimation**

::: incremental
-   Two approaches:
    1.  Via simulation (what we'll do today)
    2.  Via theoretical results and mathematical models (what we'll do in an upcoming class)
-   **Bootstrapping** to quantify the variability of the slope for the purpose of estimation:
    -   Bootstrap new samples from the original sample, i.e. take sample of size $n$ with replacement
    -   Fit models to each of the samples and estimate the slope
    -   Use features of the distribution of the bootstrapped slopes to construct a confidence interval

## Computing the CI for the slope I

Calculate the observed slope:

## Computing the CI for the slope II {.smaller}

## Computing the CI for the slope III

**Percentile method:** Compute the 95% CI as the middle 95% of the bootstrap distribution:

## Precision vs. accuracy

How can we get best of both worlds -- high precision and high accuracy?

Consider a 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence interval.

-   Which interval is most precise? Which is most accurate?

## Changing confidence level {.midi}

## confidence level: 90%
get_confidence_interval(

## confidence level: 99%
get_confidence_interval(

  level = 0.99, type = "percentile"
)
```

## Recap {.smaller}

-   **Population:** Complete set of observations of whatever we are studying, e.g., people, tweets, photographs, etc. (population size = $N$)

-   **Sample:** Subset of the population, ideally random and representative (sample size = $n$)

-   Sample statistic $\ne$ population parameter, but if the sample is good, it can be a good estimate

-   **Statistical inference:** Discipline that concerns itself with the development of procedures, methods, and theorems that allow us to extract meaning and information from data that has been generated by stochastic (random) process

-   We report the estimate with a confidence interval, and the width of this interval depends on the variability of sample statistics from different samples from the population

-   Since we can't continue sampling from the population, we bootstrap from the one sample we have to estimate sampling variability
