# Recap of last lecture

## Data: Duke Forest houses

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    x = "Area (square feet)",
    y = "Sale price (USD)",
    title = "Price and area of houses in Duke Forest"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_number())
```

## The regression model

```{r}

df_fit <- lm(price ~ area, data = duke_forest)

tidy(df_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2)

```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
intercept <- tidy(df_fit) |> filter(term == "(Intercept)") |> pull(estimate) |> round()
slope <- tidy(df_fit) |> filter(term == "area") |> pull(estimate) |> round()
```

**Slope:** For each additional square foot, we expect the sale price of Duke Forest houses to be higher by `r dollar(slope)`, on average.

## Inference for simple linear regression

-   Calculate a confidence interval for the slope, $\beta_1$

-   Conduct a hypothesis test for the slope, $\beta_1$

## Statistical inference

![Image source: Eugene Morgan © Penn State](images/04/inference.png){fig-align="center"}

## Sampling is natural {.midi}

![](images/05/soup.png){fig-alt="Illustration of a bowl of soup" fig-align="center"}

-   When you taste a spoonful of soup and decide the spoonful you tasted isn't salty enough, that's exploratory analysis
-   If you generalize and conclude that your entire soup needs salt, that's an inference
-   For your inference to be valid, the spoonful you tasted (the sample) needs to be representative of the entire pot (the population)

## Confidence interval via bootstrapping

-   Bootstrap new samples from the original sample
-   Fit models to each of the samples and estimate the slope
-   Use features of the distribution of the bootstrapped slopes to construct a confidence interval

## Bootstrapping pipeline I

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|3|4"

set.seed(210)

duke_forest |>
  specify(price ~ area)
```

## Bootstrapping pipeline II

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|5"

set.seed(210)

duke_forest |>
  specify(price ~ area) |>
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap")
```

## Bootstrapping pipeline III

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|6"

set.seed(210)

duke_forest |>
  specify(price ~ area) |>
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") |>
  fit()
```

## Bootstrapping pipeline IV

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|3"

set.seed(210)

boot_dist <- duke_forest |>
  specify(price ~ area) |>
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") |>
  fit()
```

## Visualize the bootstrap distribution

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|2"

boot_dist |>
  filter(term == "area") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```

## Compute the CI

```{r}
#| echo: false
boot_dist |>
  filter(term == "area") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```

## But first...

```{r}
#| echo: true

obs_fit <- duke_forest |>
  specify(price ~ area) |>
  fit()

obs_fit
```

## Compute 95% confidence interval {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: true

boot_dist |>
  get_confidence_interval(
    point_estimate = obs_fit,
    level = 0.95,
    type = "percentile"
  )
```

## Precision vs. accuracy

::: question
If we want to be very certain that we capture the population parameter, should we use a wider or a narrower interval? What drawbacks are associated with using a wider interval?

## Precision vs. accuracy

::: question
How can we get best of both worlds -- high precision and high accuracy?
:::

<br>

. . .

::: question
Consider a 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence interval.

-   Which interval is most precise?
-   Which is most accurate?
:::

## Changing confidence level {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: false
set.seed(210)
boot_fits <- duke_forest |>
  specify(price ~ area) |>
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") |>
  fit()
```

```{r}
#| echo: true

## confidence level: 90%
get_confidence_interval(
  boot_fits, point_estimate = obs_fit, 
  level = 0.90, type = "percentile"
) 

## confidence level: 99%
get_confidence_interval(
  boot_fits, point_estimate = obs_fit, 
  level = 0.99, type = "percentile"
)
```

# Hypothesis test for the slope

## Research question and hypotheses

"Do the data provide sufficient evidence that $\beta_1$ (the true population slope) is different from 0?"

. . .

**Null hypothesis**: there is no linear relationship between `area` and `price`

$$
H_0: \beta_1 = 0
$$

. . .

**Alternative hypothesis**: there is a linear relationship between `area` and `price`

$$
H_a: \beta_1 \ne 0
$$

## Hypothesis testing as a US court trial

::: incremental
-   **Null hypothesis**, $H_0$: Defendant is innocent
-   **Alternative hypothesis**, $H_a$: Defendant is guilty
-   **Present the evidence:** Collect data
-   **Judge the evidence:** "Could these data plausibly have happened by chance if the null hypothesis were true?"
    -   Yes: Fail to reject $H_0$

    -   No: Reject $H_0$
:::

## Hypothesis testing framework {.midi}

::: incremental
-   Start with a null hypothesis, $H_0$ that represents the status quo
-   Set an alternative hypothesis, $H_a$ that represents the research question, i.e. claim we're testing
-   Conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true and calculate a **p-value** (probability of getting the observed or a more extreme outcome given that the null hypothesis is true)
    -   if the test results suggest that the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, stick with the null hypothesis
    -   if they do, then reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative
:::

## Quantify the variability of the slope {.midi}

**for testing**

::: incremental
-   Two approaches:
    1.  Via simulation
    2.  Via mathematical models
-   Use **Permutation** to quantify the variability of the slope for the purpose of testing, *under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true*:
    -   Simulate new samples from the original sample via permutation
    -   Fit models to each of the samples and estimate the slope
    -   Use features of the distribution of the permuted slopes to conduct a hypothesis test
:::

## Permutation, described {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Use permuting to simulate data under the assumption the null hypothesis is true and measure the natural variability in the data due to sampling, [**not**]{.underline} due to variables being correlated
    -   Permute one variable to eliminate any existing relationship between the variables
-   Each `price` value is randomly assigned to the `area` of a given house, i.e. `area` and `price` are no longer matched for a given house
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
set.seed(1234)

duke_forest_rand <- duke_forest |>
  mutate(
    price_Observed = price,
    price_Permuted = sample(price, size = nrow(duke_forest))
    ) |>
  select(contains("price_"), area)
duke_forest_rand
```
:::
:::::

## Permutation, visualized

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Each of the observed values for `area` (and for `price`) exist in both the observed data plot as well as the permuted `price` plot
-   The permutation removes the relationship between `area` and `price`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| out.width: "100%"
#| fig.asp: 1.2
#| echo: false

duke_forest_rand |>
  pivot_longer(cols = contains("price_"), names_to = "price_type", names_prefix = "price_", values_to = "price") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = price_type), method = "lm", se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~price_type, nrow = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#8F2D56", "gray")) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_number()) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +
  labs(x = "Area", y = "Price")
```
:::
:::::

## Permutation, repeated

Repeated permutations allow for quantifying the variability in the slope under the condition that there is no linear relationship (i.e., that the null hypothesis is true)

```{r}
#| echo: false

set.seed(210)

df_perms_1000 <- duke_forest |>
  specify(price ~ area) |>
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |>
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute")

ggplot(df_perms_1000, 
       aes(x = area, y = price, group = replicate)) +
  geom_line(stat = "smooth", method = "lm", se = FALSE, alpha = 0.1) +
  labs(
    x = "Area (square feet)",
    y = "Sale price (USD)",
    title = "1,000 permuted samples"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(), limits = c(min(duke_forest$price), max(duke_forest$price))) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_number(), limits = c(min(duke_forest$area), max(duke_forest$area))) +
  geom_abline(intercept = intercept, slope = slope, color = "#8F2D56")
```

## Concluding the hypothesis test {.smaller}

::: question
Is the observed slope of $\hat{\beta_1} = 159$ (or an even more extreme slope) a likely outcome under the null hypothesis that $\beta = 0$? What does this mean for our original question: "Do the data provide sufficient evidence that $\beta_1$ (the true slope for the population) is different from 0?"

```{r}
#| out.width: "60%"

       aes(x = estimate)) +

  labs(x = "Slope", y = "Count",
       title = "Slopes of 1000 permuted samples") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = slope, color = "#8F2D56", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -1*slope, color = "#8F2D56", size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +

```

## Reason around the p-value {.smaller}

::: question
In a world where the there is no relationship between the area of a Duke Forest house and in its price ($\beta_1 = 0$), what is the probability that we observe a sample of `r nrow(duke_forest)` houses where the slope fo the model predicting price from area is 159 or even more extreme?
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

null_dist |>
  filter(term == "area") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = slope, color = "#8F2D56", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -1*slope, color = "#8F2D56", size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-slope, slope), breaks = seq(-150, 150, 50))
